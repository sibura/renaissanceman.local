= Notes =

1. Due to Google APIs daily quota limitations the importer can be unavailable, try later.
2. Due to Google policies, the Blogger API v3 can only be accessed by approved web services. This means you will need to connect to Blogger via your Google account, which is passed through our app at https://bloggerimporter.pipdig.rocks/api. This is for your own protection (the app is audited and approved by Google) and we do not have access to your private/personal information. The only data which is processed by the app is a disposable access token.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The importer stopped unexpectedly, why? =
The importer can stop for several reasons, most frequently reasons are:

* Restart: when you refresh the browser page 2 or more import processes can be together active, so, BIE waits for the first one finish its work.
* Timeout: the browser, a proxy, or something else, breaks the import process for some reason, usually a timeout.
* Quota exceeded: BIE uses the Google Blogger APIs, these grant a limited number of requests per day and per second, if the quota is exceeded, the importer stops.
